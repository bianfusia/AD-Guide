# LDAP Bind Credentials

- LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
- LDAP authentication is a popular mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. These include applications and systems such as:
  - Gitlab
  - Jenkins
  - Custom-developed web applications
  - Printers
  - VPNs

## Attack Vectors
- Brute-Force Password Spraying.
- Reading AD credentials in configuration files.
- LDAP Pass-Back Attacks.

## LDAP Pass-Back Attacks
- LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device's configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer.
- Try default logins like ```admin:admin``` or ```admin:password```
- LDAP default port is ```389```
- If the settings allow connection to server you can set up a ```nc -lvp 389``` to try connect to it.
